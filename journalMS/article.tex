% R -> Peacock test (computationally inificent)
% Python <- Implementation
% C <- Implementation

The Kolmogorov--Smirnov (KS) is a non--parametric method for determining whether a sample is consistent with a given probability distribution. First derived by Kolmogorov and Smirnov \citep{KStest}, the was developed in 1-D. There is still a desire to be able to test 2-D and higher distributions against eachother. As a result, the first 2-D KS test was articulated by Peacock \citep{Peacock1983}.

The \pkg{fasano.franceschini.test} package is an \proglang{R} implementation of the 2-D two-sample KS test as defined by Fasano and Franceschini \citep{Fasano1987}. This is a variant of the 2-D two-sample KS test as originally defined by Peacock \citep{Peacock1983}. In \proglang{R} \citep{R}, the only current implementation of the 2-D two-sample KS test is available in the \pkg{Peacock.test} package via the \fct{peacock2} function. The manuscript that this document is based on \citep{Fasano1987} then introduced hurdle. A \proglang{C} implementation of the Fasano Franceschini test is available in \citep{numericalRecipes}; however does not offer a bootstrapping procedure nor has been documentation for easy of use in \proglang{R} community.

% The introduction is in principle ``as usual''. However, it should usually embed
% both the implemented \emph{methods} and the \emph{software} into the respective
% relevant literature. For the latter both competing and complementary software
% should be discussed (within the same software environment and beyond), bringing
% out relative (dis)advantages. All software mentioned should be properly
% \verb|\cite{}|d. (See also Appendix~\ref{app:bibtex} for more details on
% \textsc{Bib}{\TeX}.)
%
% For writing about software JSS requires authors to use the markup
% \verb|\proglang{}| (programming languages and large programmable systems),
% \verb|\pkg{}| (software packages), \verb|\code{}| (functions, commands,
% arguments, etc.). If there is such markup in (sub)section titles (as above), a

%
% Modeling count variables is a common task in economics and the social sciences.
% The classical Poisson regression model for count data is often of limited use in
% these disciplines because empirical count data sets typically exhibit
% overdispersion and/or an excess number of zeros. The former issue can be
% addressed by extending  the plain Poisson regression model in various
% directions: e.g., using sandwich covariances or estimating an additional
% dispersion parameter (in a so-called quasi-Poisson model). Another more formal
% way is to use a negative binomial (NB) regression. All of these models belong to
% the family of generalized linear models (GLMs). However, although these models
% typically can capture overdispersion rather well, they are in many applications
% not sufficient for  modeling excess zeros. Since \cite{Mullahy:1986} there is
% increased interest in zero-augmented models that address this issue by a second
% model component capturing zero counts. An overview of count data models in
% econometrics, including  hurdle and zero-inflated models, is provided in
% \cite{Cameron+Trivedi:2013}.
%
% In \proglang{R} \citep{R}, GLMs are provided by the model fitting functions
% \fct{glm} in the \pkg{stats} package and \fct{glm.nb} in the \pkg{MASS} package
% \citep[][Chapter~7.4]{Venables+Ripley:2002} along with associated methods for
% diagnostics and inference. The manuscript that this document is based on
% \citep{Zeileis+Kleiber+Jackman:2008} then introduced hurdle and zero-inflated
% count models in the functions \fct{hurdle} and \fct{zeroinfl} in the \pkg{pscl}
% package \citep{Jackman:2015}. Of course, much more software could be discussed
% here, including (but not limited to) generalized additive models for count data
% as available in the \proglang{R} packages \pkg{mgcv} \cite{Wood:2006},
% \pkg{gamlss} \citep{Stasinopoulos+Rigby:2007}, or \pkg{VGAM} \citep{Yee:2009}.

\section{Models and software} \label{sec:models}

\subsection{1-D Kolmogorov--Smirnov Test}

The Kolmogorov--Smirnov (KS) test is a non--parametric method for determining where a sample is consistent with a given probability distribution. While a complete discussion of the 1-D KS test can be found elsewhere, we will present a brief overview as motivation for the basis and intuition of the 2-D KS test.

The 1-D KS test can be divided into to variants of the same statistical procedure:

\begin{leftbar}
\textbf{The One-Sample Test}
\begin{itemize}
\item Compares the data to an analytical distribution.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{The Two-Sample Test}
\begin{itemize}
\item Compares two data samples to determine if they are drawn from the same underlying probability distribution.
\end{itemize}
\end{leftbar}

In both cases, the KS test works as follows:

The Kolmogorov-Smimov statistic (D) is the defined by the maximum difference between the cumulative density functions of the data and model (one--sample), or between the two data sets (two--sample). In the following example, the orange and blue curve in the left panel represents the underlying distribution (pdf) for sample1 and sample2, respectively (\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:kstest1D}}). The eCDF is then defined by data drawn from these underlying distribution, and the D--stat is the computed as the largest between difference between the eCDF (black dotted line) in the right panel.

\begin{figure}[t!]
\centering
\includegraphics{pdfvsCDF}
\caption{\label{fig:kstest1D} Frequency distribution for number of days absent
from school.}
\end{figure}

Kolmogorov and Smimov work defined the cumulative distribution for a random D-stat as:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:1}
Q_{KS}(\lambda) = 2 \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} -1^{j-1}e^{-2j^2\lambda^2}
\end{equation}

and thus allows for $p$-value hypothesis testing to determine if there is a significance difference between the cumulative density functions of the data and model (one-sample), or between the two data sets (two-sample).

\textbf{For the 1-Sample case}, the $p$-value probability of a given D-stat is defined by

\begin{equation} \label{eq:2}
Prob(D > observed) = Q_{KS} ( D\sqrt{N})
\end{equation}

where $N$ is the number of data points sampled. A $p$-value $< 0.05$, indicates a significant difference between the samples.

\textbf{In the 2-Sample case}, the $p$-value probability of a given D-stat is defined by
\begin{equation} \label{eq:3}
Prob(D > observed) = Q_{KS} ( D\sqrt{\frac{n_1n_2}{n_1+n_2}})
\end{equation}

where $n1$ and $n2$ is the number of data points in the first and second samples respectively. A $p$-value $< 0.05$, indicates a significant difference between the samples.

\subsection{Higher Dimensional KS Test}

Similar to the 1-D KS test, the obvious solution to extend the theory into higher dimensional would be to define the maximal cumulative difference between the two 2-D distributions. This however, presents an issue as the commutative distribution function is not well defined in more than one dimension\citep{Peacock1983}.

\subsection{Peacock Test (1983) and Fasano Franceschini Test (1987)}
The Peacock test was the original generalization of the 1-D KS test to higher dimensions. Peacock solved the higher dimensionality issue by using the total intergrated probability -- i.e. fraction of data -- in each of the four quadrants around all possible points in the data. For example, for an given $n$ points in a two-dimensional space, the cumulative distribution functions is calculated in the $4n^2$ quadrants of the plane defined by all pairs ($X_i$ ,$Y_j$), $X_i$ and $Y_j$ being coordinates of any pairs of points in the given sample. By ranging over all possible pairs of data points and quadrants, the 2-D D-stat is defined by the maximal difference of the integrated probabilities between samples.

The slight variation defined by Fasano and Franceschini was to only consider quadrants centered in each point of the given samples to compute the cumulative distribution functions. e.g, rather than looking over all ($X_i$ ,$Y_j$; where $i,j={1,n}$), only use the detected points ($X_i$ ,$Y_i$; where $i={1,n}$). Thus for an given $n$ points in a two-dimensional space, those $n$ points define $4n$ quadrants.

The 2-D two sample Fasano and Franceschini test is illustrated in the following example to compare the 2-D distributions of orange vs blue points (\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:kstest2D}}).

\begin{figure}[t!]
\centering
\includegraphics{fftestOutput}
\caption{\label{fig:kstest2D} Frequency distribution for number of days absent
from school.}
\end{figure}

The algorithm loops through each point in the orange sample in turn to define the origin of 4 quadrants (grey dotted line). The fraction of orange and blue points in each quadrant is computed (corners of plot) and the quadrant with the maximal difference is designated the current maximum for the specified origin. By ranging over all pairs of data points and quadrants, the 2-D D-stat is defined by the maximal difference of the integrated probabilities between samples. In this case using the orange point as the origin, the maximal difference is $D = 0.35$.

This process is repeated using the blue points as the origins to compute the maximal D-stat. Finally, both maximal D-stats using the orange and blue points as origins are then averaged to compute the overall D-stat for hypothesis testing.

\subsection{Defining the Fasano and Franceschini Null Distribution}

Using Monte Carlo simulation, Fasano and Franceschini approximated the distribution of D for significance testing -- as a function of $D$, the sample size $N$, and the coefficient of correlation $r$.

\textbf{For the 1-Sample case}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:4}
Prob(D > observed) = Q_{KS} ( \frac{D\sqrt{N}}{1+\sqrt{1-r^2}(0.25-0.75/\sqrt{N})})
\end{equation}

\textbf{The 2-Sample cas}

Uses the same formula as above, but with the slight variation where

\begin{equation} \label{eq:5}
N = \frac{n_1n_2}{n_1+n_2}
\end{equation}

In both cases, $r$ is defined by:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:6}
r = \frac{\sum_{i}^{}(x_i-\bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i}^{}(x_i-\bar{x})^2}\sqrt{\sum_{i}^{}(y_i-\bar{y})^2}}
\end{equation}

% The basic Poisson regression model for count data is a special case of the GLM
% framework \cite{McCullagh+Nelder:1989}. It describes the dependence of a count
% response variable $y_i$ ($i = 1, \dots, n$) by assuming a Poisson distribution
% $y_i \sim \mathrm{Pois}(\mu_i)$. The dependence of the conditional mean
% $\E[y_i \, | \, x_i] = \mu_i$ on the regressors $x_i$ is then specified via a
% log link and a linear predictor
% %
% \begin{equation} \label{eq:mean}
% \log(\mu_i) \quad = \quad x_i^\top \beta,
% \end{equation}
% %
% where the regression coefficients $\beta$ are estimated by maximum likelihood
% (ML) using the iterative weighted least squares (IWLS) algorithm.
%
% \begin{leftbar}
% Note that around the \verb|{equation}| above there should be no spaces (avoided
% in the {\LaTeX} code by \verb|%| lines) so that ``normal'' spacing is used and
% not a new paragraph started.
% \end{leftbar}
%
% \proglang{R} provides a very flexible implementation of the general GLM
% framework in the function \fct{glm} \citep{Chambers+Hastie:1992} in the
% \pkg{stats} package. Its most important arguments are
% \begin{Code}
% glm(formula, data, subset, na.action, weights, offset,
%   family = gaussian, start = NULL, control = glm.control(...),
%   model = TRUE, y = TRUE, x = FALSE, ...)
% \end{Code}
% where \code{formula} plus \code{data} is the now standard way of specifying
% regression relationships in \proglang{R}/\proglang{S} introduced in
% \cite{Chambers+Hastie:1992}. The remaining arguments in the first line
% (\code{subset}, \code{na.action}, \code{weights}, and \code{offset}) are also
% standard  for setting up formula-based regression models in
% \proglang{R}/\proglang{S}. The arguments in the second line control aspects
% specific to GLMs while the arguments in the last line specify which components
% are returned in the fitted model object (of class \class{glm} which inherits
% from \class{lm}). For further arguments to \fct{glm} (including alternative
% specifications of starting values) see \code{?glm}. For estimating a Poisson
% model \code{family = poisson} has to be specified.
%
% \begin{leftbar}
% As the synopsis above is a code listing that is not meant to be executed,
% one can use either the dedicated \verb|{Code}| environment or a simple
% \verb|{verbatim}| environment for this. Again, spaces before and after should be
% avoided.
%
% Finally, there might be a reference to a \verb|{table}| such as
% Table~\ref{tab:overview}. Usually, these are placed at the top of the page
% (\verb|[t!]|), centered (\verb|\centering|), with a caption below the table,
% column headers and captions in sentence style, and if possible avoiding vertical
% lines.

\subsection{Fasano Franceschini Test Usage}

In their paper, Fasano and Franceschini use Monte Carlo simulation to approximate the distribution of D as a function of $D$, the sample size $N$, and the coefficient of correlation $r$. The resultant distributional approximation -- as described above in equation \ref{eq:4} -- can be used to test the significance levels for the two-dimensional K-S test.

Note that the above formulas are accurate enough when $N \geq 20$, and when the indicated probability (significance level) is less than (more significant than) 0.20 or so. When the indicated probability is $> 0.20$, its value may not be accurate, but the implication that the data and model (or two data sets) are not significantly different is certainly correct.

\subsection{Bootstrap Version of the Fasano Franceschini Test}

Some arguments have been made to the validity of the $>1$-D KS tests as not being distribution-free \citep{Babu2006}.

To combat these accretions, one can bootstrap the significance levels for the particular multidimensional statistic directly from the particular data set under study. As Fasano and Franceschini's paper was originally released in 1987, this approach was unfeasible at scale. However, as we are currently in the age of high-performance computers -- a null distribution of D-stats can be bootstrapped from the data to test significance.

The \pkg{fasano.franceschini.test} R package, implements a parallelized bootstrapping procedure. The marginal distribution from 2-dimensional data set is resampled with replacements to generate randomized 2-dimensional data set \code{nBootStrap} times. The frequency count by quadrant is performed for each bootstrapped resampling as described above to compute the D-stats. The observed D-stat is then compared to the bootstrapped D-stats to compute a $p$-value. See \fct{fasano.franceschini.test} for source code details and implementation.

Note, bootstrapping may significantly increase run time performance. To improve run time, adjust the \code{cores} parameter to specify the number of parallel operations to run. See the R \pkg{parrellel} package and the \fct{mclapply} function for further details.

\subsection{Computational Efficency}
The main distinction between the Peacock and Fasano Franceschini test comes down to compute time. For a benchmarking of the algorithms see \citep{Lopes2007}

In Summary:
\begin{itemize}
\item The Fasano Franceschini test runs in $O(n^2)$ time, and is advantageous to the Peacock test as dataset sizes scale.
\item The Peacock test is more computationally expensive, and runs in $O(n^3)$ time.
\end{itemize}

See the \pkg{Peacock.test} package for \proglang{R} implementation of the Peacock test.

% \proglang{R} code, the prompt \code{"R> "} should be used with \code{"+  "} as
% the continuation prompt. Generally, comments within the code chunks should be
% avoided -- and made in the regular {\LaTeX} text instead. Finally, empty lines
% before and after code input/output should be avoided (see above).

%% -- Bibliography -------------------------------------------------------------
%% - References need to be provided in a .bib BibTeX database.
%% - All references should be made with \cite, \citet, \citep, \citealp etc.
%%   (and never hard-coded). See the FAQ for details.
%% - JSS-specific markup (\proglang, \pkg, \code) should be used in the .bib.

%
% \section{More technical details} \label{app:technical}
%
% \begin{leftbar}
% Appendices can be included after the bibliography (with a page break). Each
% section within the appendix should have a proper section title (rather than
% just \emph{Appendix}).
%
% For more technical style details, please check out JSS's style FAQ at
% \url{https://www.jstatsoft.org/pages/view/style#frequently-asked-questions}
% which includes the following topics:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Title vs.\ sentence case.
%   \item Graphics formatting.
%   \item Naming conventions.
%   \item Turning JSS manuscripts into \proglang{R} package vignettes.
%   \item Trouble shooting.
%   \item Many other potentially helpful details\dots
% \end{itemize}
% \end{leftbar}
%
%
% \section[Using BibTeX]{Using \textsc{Bib}{\TeX}} \label{app:bibtex}
%
% \begin{leftbar}
% References need to be provided in a \textsc{Bib}{\TeX} file (\code{.bib}). All
% references should be made with \verb|\cite|, \verb|\citet|, \verb|\citep|,
% \verb|\citealp| etc.\ (and never hard-coded). This commands yield different
% formats of author-year citations and allow to include additional details (e.g.,
% pages, chapters, \dots) in brackets. In case you are not familiar with these
% commands see the JSS style FAQ for details.
%
% Cleaning up \textsc{Bib}{\TeX} files is a somewhat tedious task -- especially
% when acquiring the entries automatically from mixed online sources. However,
% it is important that informations are complete and presented in a consistent
% style to avoid confusions. JSS requires the following format.
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item JSS-specific markup (\verb|\proglang|, \verb|\pkg|, \verb|\code|) should
%     be used in the references.
%   \item Titles should be in title case.
%   \item Journal titles should not be abbreviated and in title case.
%   \item DOIs should be included where available.
%   \item Software should be properly cited as well. For \proglang{R} packages
%     \code{citation("pkgname")} typically provides a good starting point.
% \end{itemize}
