Description: An implementation of the 2-D Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) two-sample test as defined by Fasano and Franceschini (Fasano and Franceschini 1987). The 'fasano.franceschini.test' package provides three improvements over the current 2-D KS test on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN): (i) the Fasano and Franceschini test has been shown to run in O(n^2) versus the Peacock implementation which runs in O(n^3); (ii) the package implements a procedure for handling ties in the data; and (iii) the package implements a parallelized bootstrapping procedure for improved significance testing. Ultimately, the 'fasano.franceschini.test' package presents a robust statistical test for analyzing random samples defined in 2-dimensions.
